    <!--Problem-->
    <section class="m-4" id="problem">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>While GroupMe works for well for cross-platform communications and scheduling events, there are some frustrations with certain components of the system.
        The following "pain points" were created as a response to data collected from users, and serve as a response to three of the most common user complaints.</p>
        
        <h3>Pain Point 1: No ability to sort messages</h3>
        <p>GroupMe Messages are always displayed in order of recency. Unlike in many apps, 
            there is no way to keep favorites at the top, or hide muted groups. App users want to feel like they are in control, and frequently 
            become frustrated when their choices are restricted. Giving users options is essential for companies that want to stay relevant. 
            Where there are no options there is generally no business.  </p>
  
        <h3>Pain Point 2: Group chat logistics </h3>
        <p>Adding new people to a group is overly complicated and requires sifting through several menus. 
            Since chats are by far the most popular feature in GroupMe, these should be the easiest to navigate. 
            It makes sense that some of the secondary features are harder to reach. However, work could be done to 
            reduce the time it takes to add someone to a group. Group chats are supposed to be what GroupMe excels at, 
            and yet they continue to be far more complicated than they should.</p>
        
        <h3>Pain Point 3: App feels outdated</h3>
        <p>The app hasn't kept up with recent design trends. Sure, it's generally pretty user friendly, but it fails to "wow" users with its visual appearance.
        Part of that has to do with the fact that it's rather blocky - lots of hardline edges and list items laid out with hardly any interesting formatting. It
        feels a little bit like a generic, run-of-the-mill messaging app, and not a flagship, industry-standard communication tool.</p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p class="mb-0">"The app looks and feels a bit old. Maybe it can be updated to look cleaner and function smoother!"</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">GroupMe user</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p class="mb-0">"Itâ€™s boring!"</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">Another GroupMe user</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="lead"><em>Design Question:</em> How might we improve the experience of GroupMe users as they navigate and manage their conversations?</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution-->
    <section class="bg-light" id="solution">
        <h2 class="m-4 pt-4">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="m-4">By reducing the number of steps to add a new person to a group, we can simpify the user experience and keep users more likely to remain loyal to GroupMe.
        In the process, we will solve pain point #2 by removing a layer of navigation. I chose to provide a solution for this particular pain point becuase it would make the 
        biggest difference to users with the lowest learning curve. A new interface, as provided by fixing pain points 1 or 3, would undoubtedly benefit users, but would require them 
        to completely relearn the system.</p>

    <!--Conclusion-->
    <section class="m-4" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>GroupMe is a powerful app with a lot of functionality in a compact space. By refining the add members feature, we are able to further simplify and streamline the user experience. In the future, I would love to have more time dedicated to research, as there is a lot to learn from other users. I feel that a lot more that could be covered, given enough time and resources.</p>
